<title> Websites That Don't Suck and Do Suck </title></head>
<body><center><h1>What makes a good website?</h1>
A good website is subjective, but a functional website is easier to define objectively. 
A <i>bad</i> website is a site that doesn't give the user a way to easily to navigate and read (and/or
see) through its content. Not using annoyingly sized or colored type and images certainly helps
make a website more appealing, too.<br>
Here are a couple examples of a "good" website and "bad" website based on personal preference.</p>

<h2>The Bad: <a href=http://www.timecube.com/><i>Time Cube</i></a></h2>
<p>Time Cube is a site legendary for it's befuddling awfulness. For the most part, all of its
content consists of a single <i>very</i> long, <i>very</i> disjointed rant. What takes Time Cube
from strange conspiracy theory expose to a completely insane and somewhat disturbing experience
is how the site is designed. Huge type dominates, sometimes black, red, or blue, sometimes bolded, sometimes italicized, 
never following any predictable formatting rules. The pages -- laid out sequentially as if pages
in a book and not on a website -- are all incredibly long due to the giant, rambling text, making it
tiresome to scroll to the bottom, much less read the content itself. Time Cube shows how bad design
can make the curiously crazy into flat out terrifying insanity.</p>

<br><h2>The Good: <a href=http://mail.google.com><i>Gmail</i></a></h2>
<p>Gmail is a very well known and popular email service, and may not seem like anything special
on the surface as far as design goes, but that's what makes it successful. Gmail's interface is
designed to be comfortable and functional. It doesn't cover your inbox with flashy images or
script that takes an eternity to load. It's layout is basic, readable, easy to navigate, and most
importantly, accessible. Anyone can read through their Gmail inbox without getting a headache from
garish font sizes and colors or overly intricate design. It's professionally minimalist and it 
works.</p>
